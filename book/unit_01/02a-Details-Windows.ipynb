    "Many of you have opened a prompt (a terminal) for the first time in this class. **There is nothing to be afraid of**. You will use the prompt very often, but you won't need it for anything else than starting python, jupyterlab, or any other python tool of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The command prompt (or `cmd.exe`)\n",

    "In the command prompt, you can do many things, but the one thing you will really need is to **navigate** to the folder of your choice. The name of the currently active folder is always indicated at the start of the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only a few commands are necessary for this class:\n",
    "- `help`: seeing the list of commands available\n",
    "- `dir`: list the directories (folders) in the current location\n",
    "- `cd FolderName`: navigate to the folder FolderName\n",
    "- `cd ..`: navigate one folder up\n",
    "- `TAB`: ask the command prompt to complete the name for you. For example, if you are lazy and type only two letters of the desired folder, typing `TAB` might complete it for you\n",
    "- `exit`: exit the prompt (you can also simply close the window)\n",

    "\n",
    "The python interpreter can be opened in many different ways, but the way you learn first is to start it from the miniforge prompt.
