    "- **Feedback meetings (after the Christmas break):** We will arrange individual meetings with each group to receive some feedback. You will show me the structure of your package, the functionality of your code, which tests you are writing, who is writing what, a sample docstring, etc. You will also submit a first version of your package (one ``.zip`` file per group) at least 24 h before our meeting so that I can test it.\n",

    "- You could add the possibility to interpolate to model levels that are not in the data file.\n",

    "**Every member of the group should add one functionality, including tests for the new functionality.** It should be evident from the code (e.g., docstrings) who wrote which part of the code. Choose and distribute the tasks according to your respective programming skills. There is no minimum on the number of lines of code you should write, because producing many lines of code is **not** a measure of quality. The list of possible topics should help you decide on what to code, but aside from that here is a vague rule of thumb: if you coded 10 lines of code (without comments), it is probably not enough (unless they are very clever lines of code). If you coded 1000 lines of code, it is probably too much.\n",

    "By this time, I have a relatively good feeling for your programming skills and I do not want to see code that was clearly not written by you but rather by ChatGPT or your colleagues. The goal is that you get better at programming during the project, regardless of your starting level. Try to find a project you like, and convince me that you pushed your own programming limit a little bit and that you learned something in the process. So it is okay to select an easy task, as long as you write something on your own, and write good code. The difficulty of the task will, however, influence the grade in addition to the quality of the code and the tests. If you pick an \"easy\" task, you could also pick two or three tasks instead of just one. \n",
