It is a NumPy `.npz` file that was created using [numpy.savez](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html). The data file contains vertical profiles of wind speed and wind direction from a radiosonde launch during the [TEAMx](https://www.teamx-programme.org/) summer EOP.

Specifically, it should replace the two subfigures for wind speed and wind direction with a single plot that has two x axes for wind speed and direction (one at the bottom of the figure and one at the top). Also, the depth of the up-valley flow and the jet maximum should be indicated and labeled in a more pleasing way than just horizontal lines (you can decide how you want to do this). Is the code working and producing the plot you envisioned?\n",
